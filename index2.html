		<h3>About</h3>
		<div>
			<p>My first taste of bicycle fabrication began I was 13. My dad and I would make bar ends and seat post clamps on the mill and lathe, and I took them to my local bike shop to trade for other parts. Taking those pieces of metal and turning them into something that could actually be used on a bicycle really got me interested in fabrication. From there, I would make anything involving metalwork. This included everything from roll cages to furniture. Once I was in college, I was lucky enough to get a job welding for a BMX company. I learned by welding sub-assemblies for frames, handlebars, seat posts, general frame fabrication, and machining.</p>

			<p>After college I entered the workforce as an environmental analyst, but after several years I realized that I wasnâ€™t suited to being in an office all day. I wanted to make bicycles again. I began making frames for friends and family during nights and weekends, and paying the bills by building satellites during the day.</p>

			<p>I currently make frames, forks, stems, racks, cable hangers, and the occasional friction shifter in Los Angeles. I prefer building town/city, porteur, and randonneur bikes. That said, I'm interested in building just about anything as long as its main purpose is for having fun.</p>
